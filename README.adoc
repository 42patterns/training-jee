= Java EE trainings snippets and exercises

This project contains sample projects for Java EE trainings

jee6-example::
Basic whole stack example: from database to a REST webservice endpoint

exercises::
Training exercises; assignments together with sample solutions

server-config::
Server configuration files required to successfully run the sample projects

== Project setup

The examples are running on Hibernate (as the JPA provider) and MySQL. Can be run on http://tomee.apache.org/[TomEE] as well as
http://www.wildfly.org/[WildFly]. For both MySQL datasource must be configured (with mysql-connector-java jar being placed in the lib folder of the application server). Configuration files can be found in _server-config_ folder

While OpenJPA is the default provider shipped with TomEE, additional configuration steps are needed to run TomEE with Hibernate - as described http://tomee.apache.org/tomee-and-hibernate.html[via official TomEE documentation]
